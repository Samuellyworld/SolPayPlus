## 🎉 About.
It is estimated that 22 million people, 10.34% of Nigeria's total population, currently own cryptocurrency. Of those 22 million people, We estimate that about above 30% of them would have encountered solana. Many thanks to the transactions per second of the blockchain, the exceptionally low fee, and scalability. Solana NFTs have also helped onboard a lot of the Crypto population in Nigeria into the solana ecosystem.

To onboard more users across Africa, we need to look at building products in crypto that help users make payment for essential services with crypto.

SolPayPlus would help our users use Solana Pay to pay for over 50 essential services in Nigeria and in extension Africa.

## 💫 Problem Description.
The African Traditional payment market is highly
competitive, with several players offering mobile payment
solutions. However, Solpayplus differentiates itself by
providing a low-cost, secure, and rewarding platform for
paying everyday bills. Our focus on Crypto payments,
customer needs and rewards program sets us apart from
traditional payment solutions.

With Solpayplus, we're providing a solution to the market's needs,
offering a low-cost, easy-to-use platform that rewards users for
paying their bills. With the growth of the African market, we're
excited to be at the forefront of innovation, providing payment
solutions that address the unique needs of African consumers.

## 🚀 The Solution.
We introduced SolPayPlus to allow for payment of
over 17,000 bills in categories such as airtime, data
bundles, Internet, electricity, cable TV, and
Government agency dues in Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda,
Kenya, Zimbabwe and more.

## ✅ Market Opportunity
The African market presents a significant opportunity for payment
platforms. According to recent reports, more than 60% of Africans
are unbanked, making it challenging to access traditional payment
methods. However, mobile phone penetration is high, making it
easier to provide mobile payment solutions.
